# xOvermod

## About the bot

This is my first ever Discord bot, made using Node, discord.js, and discord.js dependencies. It is intended to function as a moderation bot on my personal Discord server ([Join Here](https://discord.gg/8NMyWPgNnX)). The bot has basic moderation functions, as well as other miscellaneous features.

## Syntax

The bot prefix is `,`. Baisc command syntax is

```
,command { user } { arguments }
```

This bot accepts both user mentions (i.e. @user), or user IDs (i.e. 123456789012345678) for all commands which affect a user. To find the arguments for any given command, type `,help { command }`. The bot will reply with an embed detailing the command and its syntax.

When the syntax is provided (both in this README and in embeds), `?` before an argument represents an optional value.
